App 1:

Working Title - Follow me!

Type of XR and Target Platform - AR. iOS and Android.

Elevator Pitch - An AR app that the user would download at the doors of a store and when opened it'd display arrows and signs for the user to follow
across the store showign the best prices or whatever he/she is looking for. Also, as they walk some things might appear so the user gets to discover new products.

Visual Reference - Attached some images of my home as if it was a store where you can see the arrows taking you to a super price!


App 2:

Working Title - Master bender.

Type of XR and Target Platform - VR - (Google's Daydream / cardboard and similars) or AR.

Elevator Pitch - Always wanted to bend the elements at will and engage in epic battles with friends and enemies? Now you can! Pick and element - earth, fire
water or air - and become a master bender (If Nickelodean likes the idea, obviously an Avatar themed app!)

Visual Reference - None, I think it's self-explanatory

App 3:

Working Title - Augmented Card

Type of XR and Target Platform - AR. iOS and Android.

Elevator Pitch - An app that would generate a mini AR presentation from a presentation card, so the card itself could contain a QR for download and
instructions so the user (the one that recieves the card) would be able to enjoy and be impressed by a futuristic business card or pamflet!

Visual Reference - Imagine the pizza pamflet had a QR and the instructions :)
